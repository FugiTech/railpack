Railpack is a tool for building images from source code with minimal
configuration. It is the successor to [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com) and
incorporates many of the learnings from running Nixpacks in production at
[Railway](https://railway.com) for several years.

## Documentation

Railpack is an early work in progress and constantly evolving. Documentation for
both operators and users is available at [railpack.com](https://railpack.com).

## Contributing

Railpack is open source and open to contributions. Keep in mind that the project
is early and core architectural changes are still being made.

Contributions are not being accepted at this time as we are still focusing on
setting up the core architecture. Issues or questions are still welcome.
